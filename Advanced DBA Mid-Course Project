1) Import Q2 order_item and refund data into the database using the following files

This is done by simply using the table data import wizard. If a table was not created for the data, one would need to be created or if the script/file had that sql statements to create the table then all you would need to do is run the script. However, this is just importing data into tables so therefore you would just to make sure the columns match up and that the data types match up.
 
2) Next, your help is needed updating the structure of the order_items table. 
The company is going to start cross-selling products, and will want to track 
whether each item sold is the primary item (the first one put into the user’s shopping cart) 
or a cross-sold item. Add a binary column to order_items called is_primary_item. 

ALTER TABLE order_items
ADD COLUMN is_primary_item BOOL;

Simple boolean data type that can be true or false.

3) Update all previous records in the order_items table, setting is_primary_item = 1 
all records. Up until now, all items sold were the primary item (cross-selling is new). 
Confirm this change has executed successfully. 

UPDATE order_items
SET is_primary_item = 1
WHERE order_item_id > 0;

Since it is in safe mode I had to utilize the primary key, however this could have been done without a where statement since it is updating every record.

4) After adding 2 new products to the products table, Import the remainder of 2013 order_item and refund data. 
Confirm successful import. Use the product values below and these files:  
-- 10.order_items_2013_Jul-Dec
-- 11.order_item_refunds_2013_Jul-Dec

INSERT INTO products VALUES 
(3,'2013-12-12 09:00:00', 'The Birthday Sugar Panda'),
(4,'2014-02-05 10:00:00', 'The Hudson River Mini Bear');

Then going through and updating the the other two tables with more data by importing through the wizard.

5) Your CEO would like your help making sure your database has a high degree of data integrity 
and bad data doesn’t start creeping in as more people start using the database. 
If you see any opportunities to ensure data integrity by using constrains like NON-NULL, 
add them to the relevant columns in the tables you have created . 

ALTER TABLE `mavenbearbuilders`.`order_items` 
CHANGE COLUMN `is_primary_item` `is_primary_item` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL;
